## Interactive room detection
My master thesis. An implementation of a computer graphics algorithm to generate Rooms and Portals partition based on input of walls in Unity engine. The algorithm splits a scene into separate rooms and generate potentially visible sets for each of the rooms. [link](https://dspace.cvut.cz/handle/10467/114629)
